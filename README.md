This is the Snakemake workflow for reproducing the calculations and data analysis of our paper

[Theory of Field-Dependent NMR Shifts in Paramagnetic Molecules](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1z8v9)

In order to run the workflow, you need to have [Julia](https://julialang.org/) with the [ParaMag.jl](https://github.com/LucasLang/ParaMag.jl) package installed.
Furthermore, you need [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io) in your path.

Once you have Julia, you can install `ParaMag.jl` via starting the Julia REPL by typing `julia` in a terminal, then entering Pkg mode by pressing the `]` key and entering the following commands:
- `add https://github.com/LucasLang/OutputParser.jl`
- `add https://github.com/LucasLang/ParaMag.jl.git`

In order to install Snakemake, you can e.g. enter the following commands (requires conda, e.g. through a [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/) installation):
```bash
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda create --name snakemake python=3.11
conda activate snakemake
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake
```

Usage:
```bash
cd workflow
snakemake -c1 --use-conda --conda-frontend conda
```
